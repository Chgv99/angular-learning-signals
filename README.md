# Angular Learning - Signals

Angular project built to follow Angular's official [signals tutorial](https://angular.dev/tutorials/signals)

This tutorial is not meant to be followed using a local Angular project, but I did anyways. The tutorial is meant to be followed with the online code editor that Angular provides along-side the tutorial itself, and they sometimes change the source code inside to explain different things.

You'll find that the `app.ts` file uses multiple components. Each of them contains the solution to one step from the [official tutorial](https://angular.dev/tutorials/signals) (except for the first two steps, whose solution has been overwritten with step three's because the example was the same).

In any case, you'll find a single page with all the working solutions for the tutorial. To launch it locally:
1. Clone the project
2. `npm install`
3. `ng serve` or `npm start`
