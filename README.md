# Angular Learning - Signals

Angular project built to follow Angular's official [signals tutorial](https://angular.dev/tutorials/signals)

This tutorial is not meant to be followed using a local Angular project, but I did anyways. The tutorial is meant to be followed with the online code editor that Angular provides along-side the tutorial itself, and they sometimes change the source code inside to explain different things.

Whenever this happened, I either updated the source code or created a different component for it.

> At the time of writing this README, I have two different components: `user-dashboard` and `user-profile-loader`. Both of them are used by the root app component. I believe that I will follow this dynamic until the end of the tutorial.
